6/15/2021 12:03:06	vector	how is this all connected? how do I remember these commands?	
6/15/2021 12:03:43	How to assign values to variables and navigating R studio.	I am very confused about factors. I felt that that session went way too quickly.	
6/15/2021 12:03:59	changing/working with variables	I don't understand the values (factors, numeric, characters)	The last instructor went to fast and covered too much material
6/15/2021 12:04:00	How to load datasets into RStudio and how to download packages	I got confused towards the end of the session where we began discussing vectors and converting data	Thank you, I thought the etherpad was great and I appreciated the links in the WebEx chat to supplement the teachings.
6/15/2021 12:05:10	i learned how data frames & vectors work	I would like clarification on changing things into factors, I'm a little confused on that topic	n/a
6/15/2021 12:05:15	how assign objects and find information about commands with help() or ?command	I didn't have any question	n/a
6/15/2021 12:54:03	data summary and viewing comands	purpose of changing forms of data	
6/17/2021 11:59:18	the filter function		I appreciated the pace of this lesson!
6/17/2021 11:59:22	select() and filter()	N/a	n/a
6/17/2021 11:59:50	learned a lot of really great commands--especially the pipline	i didnt understand the brackets	i like working through data files and see how they change to understand the commands
6/17/2021 12:00:17	Combining filter and select function	Instead of filtering out day 0, how would you remove it from your original data frame?	No, thank you!
6/17/2021 12:00:35	all the different commands were beneficial	what does the %>% command actually mean	I like the pace we went at today, I understood every step of what was being done
6/17/2021 12:00:45	I learned about dplyr and how to work better with data (I'm more comfortable with vectors)	Can we please review the square bracket purpose	Good session today, I arrived a little late so missed the first ~20min of session, but was able to catch up in the chat.
9/15/2021 11:56:18	A Refresher on common commands		
9/15/2021 11:56:34	I learned coercion and the hierarchy of coercion, which I thought was useful.	None!	
9/15/2021 11:57:34	The resources provided are very helpful	What instances should you write in the upper and lower boxes on the left	Maybe be a bit more collaborative when doing something for the first time - was a bit fast paced right from the jump because I'm not at all familiar with coding of any sort.
9/15/2021 11:57:34	Basic coding techniques/skills	Still not clear on the ranking of vector types, but I am sure that will come with practice.	Thank you for being patient with us! 
9/15/2021 11:58:30	keeping good comments throughout the code 	how to add vectors together	
9/15/2021 11:59:11	The coercion hierarchy 	I don't have any questions at the moment	I would love to take an introduction to python class!
9/15/2021 12:00:31	learnt so many actually.  how to create object, what are vectors etc	could not understand " logical → numeric → character ← logical"   hierarchy 	It was perfect for day 1, thanks
9/15/2021 12:01:53	adding notes into the code file to save for later	How do I combine functions to run 2-3 actions in one line of code?	vector and data types exercise 1 was difficult to follow because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be writing for the code to figure that out. Maybe add some suggestions in that section?  I really like R and at the moment it seems easier than Linux (my first coding effort) due to the built in support. Why would use Linux over Python or R for bioinformatics? At Uconn the Bio program definitely preferred Linux.
9/15/2021 12:02:45	R intro, Tips about seeking help, Objects, Vectors, general practice using R	some short cut commands that save time, like clean the console pad etc. How to properly close and save a project 	No, everyone (instructor and helper) was super helpful!
9/17/2021 12:03:08	Inputting data into R studio	I just need practice 	Thank you for you patients with us!!! 
9/17/2021 12:06:10	How to pull up data sets	How to find the right command/function to execute what you are attempting to accomplish	Not particularly :)
9/17/2021 12:08:31	making data subsets	Are the . used in writing a pathway similar to those in Linux? . = goes one level above ..=root	
9/22/2021 12:01:16	Filtering data	How to make a new csv file from filtered data 	
9/22/2021 12:03:39	Being able to make bar graphs and other plots is very helpful	I'm just not sure where any of the materials we've been covering can be used in real-life applications.	I don't understand what the various symbols mean. i.e. %>% and ->. I understand they need to be used, but I don't understand their meaning 
9/22/2021 12:04:17	I learned how to isolate data from a dataframe!	I am confused as to why you need the %>% operator in between the data you are isolating and functions like range() and mean().	
9/22/2021 12:05:06	The pipping (%>%) seems very helpful	When are tibbles used instead of data frames?
